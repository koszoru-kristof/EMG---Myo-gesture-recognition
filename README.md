# Myo Helicopter control (EMG)

## MYO Gesture recognition

The gesture recognition is based on a Machine Learning Classifier developed in matlab using the 8 EMG sensors of the MYO bracelet. After the data collection and the model training, the software is able to recognise 6 predefined actions and send it to the Unity game module via ZMQ to control the Helicopter position and motion.
